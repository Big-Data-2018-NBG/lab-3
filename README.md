# ELEN4020 Data Intensive Computing
## Lab - 3
This lab required Matrix multiplication to be implemented using MapReduce. For the lab two types of MapReduce algorithms were implmented. Namely a one step MapReduce and a two step MapReduce.

## MrJob
The MrJob framwork was used for the MapReduce. The code thus requires MrJob to be installed.

## Code and Documentation
The final code can be found in the 'final-solution' branch. The code will then be in the code folder. Question 6 is in its own folder which includes the results of the matrix multiplication. The final report can be found in the documents folder.
